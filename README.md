# Transfer-Learning-for-Image-Classification-using-MobileNetV2-and-ResNet50
This project applies transfer learning using pre-trained MobileNetV2 and ResNet50 models to perform image classification on a custom dataset. Both models were evaluated using feature extraction and full fine-tuning approaches.
